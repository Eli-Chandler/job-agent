# Job Agent

An agent for finding and applying to jobs

## Planned Features

* Search for jobs on various platforms, let user select jobs to apply to
* Apply to jobs using a pre-defined resume and cover letter
    * Fine tune resume and cover letter for each job
* A/B tracking of resume and cover letter performance
* Use playwright to automate the application process
* Track job applications and their status
* Control mailbox to (send?) and receive emails related to job applications
* Track job interviews and their outcomes
* Create a very large knowledgebase of all projects/experiences and LLM can pick and choose which to use to fine tune resume

## Further ideas:

* Ask user if they have skills from the job listing, remember skills the user has selected in the past

## Remember:

* Maybe we just return job DTO to users instead of creating it from link and then they can just upload it themselves'
* This lets them modify details more naturally
* Resume generation -- instead of uploading resumes we can have a knowledgebase that can be populated from resume
